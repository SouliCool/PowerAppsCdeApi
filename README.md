# PowerAppsCdeApi - Elia Group PoweApps Hackathon

##The Business Need
Elia Group is applying the BIM methodology in building new infrastructure projects. A key software component in BIM architecture is the Common Data Environment (CDE). CDE is seen as a database and a documentation system in the ACE industry. It's the single source of truth for all project participants and for all engineering disciplines. CDE contains all project-related data. 3D models, images from the sites, schedules, contacts, and bills of materials are examples of the data that is stored, tracked and versioned in a CDE.
At Elia, we continue to automate and integrate many data sources and make the project managers' and engineers' life easier! Therefore, We have an idea to integrate the CDE data into Microsoft Teams. There is no need to jump between multiple apps to share and collaborate. 
We will use the Microsoft Power Apps platform to develop a PoC. The proposed solution will connect to the CDE via its REST API. We can then retrieve a list of projects and their documents, and present them in MS Teams. Mircosoft Power Apps will help us to build the solution with almost no coding!
